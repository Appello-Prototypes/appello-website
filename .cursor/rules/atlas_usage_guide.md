# ATLAS Usage Guide & Rules

## üéØ CRITICAL ATLAS RULES

### Core Principle: ONE QUESTION, ONE CONCEPT
- **NEVER ask compound questions** - ATLAS will timeout
- **Each query must focus on a single idea**
- **Build understanding iteratively through sequential questions**
- **Break complex research into simple, focused queries**

## üö´ WHAT NOT TO DO

### ‚ùå Compound Questions (WILL TIMEOUT)
```
‚ùå "What is Appello, include information about target customers, their pain points, pricing and the marketing strategy"

‚ùå "Tell me about the construction industry, target demographics, pain points, and competitive landscape"

‚ùå "Explain Appello's features, benefits, pricing model, and implementation process"
```

### ‚ùå Overly Broad Queries
```
‚ùå "Tell me everything about Appello"
‚ùå "What should I know about construction contractors?"
‚ùå "Explain the entire business model"
```

## ‚úÖ WHAT TO DO

### ‚úÖ Single-Concept Questions
```
‚úÖ "What is Appello?"
‚úÖ "Who are Appello's target customers?"
‚úÖ "What are the main pain points for construction contractors?"
‚úÖ "What is Appello's pricing structure?"
‚úÖ "What is Appello's marketing strategy?"
```

### ‚úÖ Focused Follow-up Questions
```
‚úÖ "What specific problems does Appello solve for contractors?"
‚úÖ "How does Appello's time tracking work?"
‚úÖ "What are the main features of Appello?"
‚úÖ "Who are Appello's main competitors?"
```

## üìã ATLAS RESEARCH METHODOLOGY

### Step 1: Start with Foundation Questions
1. "What is [Company/Product]?"
2. "Who is the target customer for [Company/Product]?"
3. "What industry does [Company/Product] serve?"

### Step 2: Dive into Customer Understanding
1. "What are the main pain points for [target customers]?"
2. "What challenges do [customers] currently face?"
3. "How do [customers] currently solve [specific problem]?"

### Step 3: Explore Product/Solution
1. "What are the main features of [Product]?"
2. "How does [Product] solve [specific pain point]?"
3. "What makes [Product] different from alternatives?"

### Step 4: Business Model Deep Dive
1. "What is [Company's] pricing structure?"
2. "How does [Company] acquire customers?"
3. "What is [Company's] revenue model?"

### Step 5: Market & Competition
1. "Who are [Company's] main competitors?"
2. "What is the market size for [industry/solution]?"
3. "What are current market trends in [industry]?"

### Step 6: Implementation & Success
1. "How is [Product] typically implemented?"
2. "What results do customers see with [Product]?"
3. "What are common success metrics for [Product]?"

## üîÑ ITERATIVE RESEARCH PATTERN

### Research Session Structure
```
Session Goal: Understand Appello's value proposition

Query 1: "What is Appello?"
‚Üí Wait for response, analyze
‚Üí Identify follow-up areas

Query 2: "Who are Appello's target customers?"
‚Üí Wait for response, analyze
‚Üí Build on previous knowledge

Query 3: "What specific problems does Appello solve?"
‚Üí Continue building comprehensive picture
```

### Building Context Across Queries
- Reference previous answers in follow-ups
- Build complexity gradually
- Connect insights from multiple queries
- Synthesize information after each response

## ‚è±Ô∏è TIMEOUT MANAGEMENT

### Timing Considerations
- **Short queries process faster**
- **Simple language reduces processing time**
- **Specific terms are better than generic descriptions**
- **Wait for complete response before next query**

### Query Optimization
```
‚úÖ Good: "What is Appello's pricing model?"
‚ùå Timeout Risk: "Explain Appello's entire pricing structure, including tiers, features, discounts, and implementation costs"

‚úÖ Good: "What pain points does Appello address?"
‚ùå Timeout Risk: "What are all the problems construction contractors face and how does Appello solve each one"
```

## üìù DOCUMENTATION STRATEGY

### During Research
- **Document each query and response**
- **Note follow-up questions immediately**
- **Track information gaps**
- **Build knowledge map progressively**

### After Each Response
1. Summarize key insights
2. Identify what's still unknown
3. Plan next logical question
4. Connect to previous learnings

## üéØ SAMPLE RESEARCH SEQUENCE

### Complete Appello Research Example
```
1. "What is Appello?"
   ‚Üí Learn: Construction management software

2. "Who uses Appello?"
   ‚Üí Learn: Mechanical, electrical, specialty contractors

3. "What problems does Appello solve?"
   ‚Üí Learn: Time tracking, payroll, job costing issues

4. "How does Appello's time tracking work?"
   ‚Üí Learn: Mobile app, GPS, photo verification

5. "What is Appello's pricing?"
   ‚Üí Learn: Per-user monthly pricing

6. "Who competes with Appello?"
   ‚Üí Learn: Other construction software providers

7. "What results do Appello customers see?"
   ‚Üí Learn: Time savings, cost reductions, accuracy improvements
```

## üîç RESEARCH QUALITY CHECKS

### Before Asking
- [ ] Is this question focused on ONE concept?
- [ ] Can this be broken down further?
- [ ] Does this build on previous knowledge?
- [ ] Is the language simple and clear?

### After Response
- [ ] Did I get complete information on this topic?
- [ ] What logical follow-up questions arise?
- [ ] How does this connect to previous answers?
- [ ] What areas need deeper exploration?

## üé® CREATIVE RESEARCH TECHNIQUES

### Progressive Narrowing
```
Broad ‚Üí Specific
"What industry challenges exist?" 
‚Üí "What time tracking challenges exist?"
‚Üí "What mobile time tracking features matter most?"
```

### Perspective Shifting
```
Different Viewpoints:
- Customer perspective: "What do contractors struggle with?"
- Product perspective: "How does Appello work?"
- Business perspective: "How does Appello make money?"
- Competitive perspective: "How is Appello different?"
```

### Context Building
```
Layer Understanding:
Foundation: What is it?
‚Üí Problem: What does it solve?
‚Üí Solution: How does it work?
‚Üí Value: What results does it deliver?
‚Üí Market: Who else provides alternatives?
```

## üöÄ ADVANCED ATLAS STRATEGIES

### Research Sprint Method
1. **Plan**: List 10-15 single-concept questions
2. **Execute**: Ask questions sequentially
3. **Synthesize**: Combine insights after each 3-5 queries
4. **Iterate**: Adjust remaining questions based on learnings

### Knowledge Gap Analysis
- Track what you know vs. what you need
- Identify the biggest unknowns
- Prioritize questions by importance
- Circle back to fill gaps

### Validation Technique
- Ask the same concept from different angles
- Cross-reference information across queries
- Look for consistency in responses
- Note any contradictions for further exploration

## üìä SUCCESS METRICS
