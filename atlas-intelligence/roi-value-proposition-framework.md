- Efficiency Gains = (Faster Billing + Better Utilization)
```

### Example: 50-Person Insulation Contractor

#### Investment
- Onboarding: $7,500
- Monthly: 50 users Ã— $100 = $5,000/month
- Annual: $67,500

#### Savings
- Payroll: 6 hrs/week Ã— $50/hr Ã— 52 = $15,600
- Billing accuracy: $2,000/month = $24,000
- Field efficiency: 10% improvement = $50,000
- **Total Annual Savings**: $89,600

#### ROI
- **Payback Period**: 2.7 months
